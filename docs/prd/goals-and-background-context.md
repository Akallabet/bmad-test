# Goals and Background Context

## Goals

- Deliver a working to-do app deployed to production within 2 hours (from spec completion to deployment)
- Create a compelling portfolio artifact demonstrating end-to-end capability (ideation → architecture → deployment)
- Demonstrate that the BMAD methodology + AI-assisted development accelerates delivery without sacrificing code quality
- Establish a reusable workflow template for future rapid prototyping projects
- Prove capability to ship complete, functional products independently

## Background Context

This project addresses a gap in developer portfolios: most showcase either code without context (repositories) or process without results (case studies), but rarely both. This to-do application serves as a living demonstration of the BMAD (BMad Method) combined with Claude Code for AI-assisted development.

The app itself is intentionally simple—five core features (Add, Edit, Archive, Restore, Sort)—because the product is not the feature set, it's the *method*. The 2-hour build constraint forces ruthless prioritization and proves that structured thinking accelerates rather than impedes velocity. The complete artifacts (PRD, Architecture, Stories, code) will be publicly accessible, making this both a functional app and a methodology showcase for developers, potential clients, and employers.
